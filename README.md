Description of the Task

This project implements a basic recommendation system using Java collections. The goal of the task is to simulate how online platforms like shopping websites or streaming services suggest products or content to users based on preferences of similar users.

In this program, a set of predefined users and the items they like are stored using a HashMap. Each user is associated with a list of products such as laptops, smartphones, cameras, smartwatches, and headphones. When a user enters their name, the system analyzes what other users like and recommends items that the current user has not yet liked.

The project focuses on applying core Java concepts such as:

HashMap and HashSet

ArrayList

Iteration using loops

Scanner class for input

Conditional logic

Set-based filtering to avoid duplicate recommendations

This recommendation model is rule-based and very simple, but it clearly demonstrates the basic working principle behind collaborative filtering systems used in real-world applications.

 What the Program Does

Stores sample data of users and their liked products.

Takes a username as input from the console.

Validates whether the entered user exists.

Retrieves the list of items liked by that user.

Compares preferences with other users.

Finds new items that the current user has not liked yet.

Displays those items as recommendations.

Avoids duplicates using a HashSet.

Shows a friendly message if no recommendations are available.
