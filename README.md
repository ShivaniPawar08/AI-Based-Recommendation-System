This project was developed as part of my internship at CodTech IT Solutions in the Java Programming domain.
The objective of this task was to design and implement an AI-based recommendation system that can suggest products to users based on the preferences and ratings of other similar users.

The system follows a Collaborative Filtering approach, which is a common technique used in real-world recommendation engines such as those found in e-commerce and streaming platforms. Instead of using fixed rules, the program analyzes historical user-item ratings and applies mathematical similarity calculations to predict which items a particular user is most likely to enjoy.

Cosine similarity is used to measure how close two users are in terms of their interests. Based on this similarity score, the system weights the opinions of similar users more heavily and generates personalized recommendations. This makes the solution data-driven and adaptive, reflecting core principles of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

What the Program Does

Stores user–item ratings in memory

Builds a user preference matrix

Calculates similarity between users using cosine similarity

Applies collaborative filtering to predict unseen item ratings

Generates personalized recommendations

Sorts recommendations based on predicted preference scores

Displays the final suggested products for the selected user
